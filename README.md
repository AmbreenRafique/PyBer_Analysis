## Analysing rideshare data for PyBer 
### Results
The table shows the weekly fare of the first four months (date range: 2019-01-01 through 2019-04-28) according to the type of cities.
   By analysing the weekly data we have concluded that dates do not have noticiable impact on weekly counts other that the 4th week of February where demand is high.
   Data demonstrates that demand is highest in urban areas compared to suburban and rural.

 ## Summary
 1. Extending services in other Rural and suburban cities with the same ratio of drivers would be good.
 2. Slightly reducing the number of drivers in Urban areas will improve the average fare per driver.
 3. Demand is high in Urban areas, a slight increase in fare can also improve the average fare per ride as well as average fare per driver.
